   <p><font color="black" size="4"> Programming languages are used to control the performance of the computer or machine. At present, computer programmer has many choices to choose the language, but there are many differences between programming languages. So, this article gives a brief information regarding what are the different types of programming languages, differences between programming languages and types of programming languages in useful ways.</font><p>
 

 <h2> <font color="black"size="5" ><i><u> What are Computer Programming Languages?</u> </i> </font > </h2> 
 <p> <font color="black" size="4">Computer programming languages allow us to give instructions to a computer in a language the computer understands. Just as many human-based languages exist, there are an array of computer programming languages that programmers can use to communicate with a computer. The portion of the language that a computer can understand is called a “binary.” Translating programming language into binary is known as “compiling.” Each language, from C Language to Python, has its own distinct features, though many times there are commonalities between programming languages </fo<font color="white" size="4"nt> </p>
 <p><font color="black" size="4">These languages allow computers to quickly and efficiently process large and complex swaths of information. For example, if a person is given a list of randomized numbers ranging from one to ten thousand and is asked to place them in ascending order, chances are that it will take a sizable amount of time and include some errors.</font></p>
  
 <h2 style="text-align: justify;"> <font color="black" ><i><u>Functional Programming Language:</u></i> </font ></h2>
 <p style="text-align: justify;"><font color="black" size="4">Functional programming language typically uses stored data, frequently avoiding loops in favor of recursive functions.The functional programing’s&nbsp; primary focus is on the return values of functions, and side effects and different suggests that storing state are powerfully discouraged. For example, in an exceedingly pure useful language, if a function is termed, it’s expected that the function not modify or perform any o/p. It may, however, build algorithmic calls and alter the parameters of these calls. Functional languages are usually easier and build it easier to figure on abstract issues, however, they’ll even be “further from the machine” therein their programming model makes it difficult to know precisely, but the code is decoded into machine language (which are often problematic for system programming).</font></p>
      <p><font color="black" size="5">There are dozens of programming languages used in the industry today.We’ve compiled overviews of the 4 most important, relevant and in-demand of these languages below:</font></p>
